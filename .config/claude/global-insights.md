# Global Insights

**Purpose:** Cross-cutting patterns that manifest differently across domains. These are universal tendencies discovered through various projects that may appear in new contexts with different specifics.

**How this works:** Each pattern below has a universal description. In domain-specific `key-insights-[domain].md` files, you'll find how that pattern manifests in that particular context.

**For working style and communication preferences:** See `working-with-nelson.md`

## Methodology Over Category

### Universal Pattern
Nelson's value is organized by a consistent *methodology* applied across domains, not by output categories (developer, designer, architect, writer). Job listings, creative fields, and most professional contexts are organized by outputs—but Nelson's skill set is organized by a repeatable process.

### The Methodology (6 Steps)

1. **Define the problem space** — What are we actually trying to solve?
2. **Deep domain immersion** — Study the field systematically (books, courses, existing works, observation)
3. **Pattern recognition across domains** — Look at how others have solved similar problems in different contexts
4. **Apply and prototype** — Put theory into practice, even imperfectly
5. **Create feedback loops** — Get external input, iterate based on real response
6. **Refine iteratively** — Deepen and add nuance as understanding matures

### Why This Matters
This explains the recurring "70-80% qualified" pattern. Nelson will always be slightly misaligned with roles/opportunities defined by their outputs because his value isn't in any single output category—it's in the methodology itself.

The misalignment isn't a gap to close. It's structural: opportunities are organized by category, Nelson is organized by methodology.

### Where Nelson's Strength Lives
The architecture, not the implementation. Plotting the global story, not writing the prose. Designing the system, not necessarily coding every line. Nelson can do implementation—and has, extensively—but the comparative advantage is in the **understanding → structure → articulation** phase (steps 1-3).

### How to Recognize It
- Nelson describes work in terms of "figuring out" rather than "building"
- Cross-domain pattern recognition appears in explanations
- The same analytical approach shows up across unrelated fields
- Value created often comes from seeing structure others missed

### How to Respond
When evaluating fit for opportunities:
- Ask: "Does this value the methodology, or just the output?"
- Look for: strategy, discovery, due diligence, consulting, advisory—roles that pay for *figuring out what's going on*
- Avoid: roles that assume deep specialization in one output category

### Domain Manifestations
- **Career:** Solutions Architect, Technical Strategist, Staff Engineer roles value the full methodology
- **Creative:** Director/Producer roles (hold structure, articulate to executors) vs. craft specialist roles
- **Planning:** Strategic advisor vs. tactical executor

### Relationship to Other Patterns
- **Output Over Outcome:** Methodology Over Category explains *why* Output Over Outcome matters—judging by execution quality (not vanity metrics) is correct because the value is in the process, not the category
- **Discounting Integration Work:** Implementation (step 4) is one phase; the value is in steps 1-3
- **Option C Blind Spot:** Understanding methodology-over-category helps see paths that don't fit output categories but do fit the methodology

## Output Over Outcome

### Universal Pattern
Judge work by execution quality and what it actually delivers, not by external validation or impact metrics that don't reflect the work's true value.

### Why This Matters
It's easy to discount excellent work because it doesn't have visible external markers of success. This pattern catches the tendency to measure against the wrong metrics.

### How to Recognize It
Nelson discounting work because:
- "Not many people use/read/saw it"
- "It's not well-known"
- "I never got recognition for it"
- "It didn't go viral / get published / win awards"

### How to Respond
Redirect to execution-based questions:
- "Does it still work?"
- "How long has it been running/in use?"
- "Did it accomplish what it was designed to do?"
- "What's the quality of the craft?"

### Domain Manifestations
- **Career:** "It doesn't have many users" → Reframe to production stability, years running
- **Creative:** "It's not published" → Reframe to craft quality, completion, what was learned
- **Planning:** "We didn't win" → Reframe to execution quality, growth, team development

## Option C Blind Spot

### Universal Pattern
When facing a decision, Nelson may see only the obvious options (often a false binary) while missing a third path that's actually available and potentially better suited to his situation.

### Why This Matters
This pattern has historically led to significant opportunity costs—not from choosing wrong between visible options, but from not seeing viable alternatives at all.

### How to Recognize It
- Framing decisions as either/or when they might not be
- "I can either X or Y" without considering Z
- Preparation-as-procrastination: "I need to [prepare more] before I can [take action]"
- Not seeing paths that require asking, applying, or putting himself forward

### How to Respond
1. Ask: "What are ALL the options here, not just the obvious ones?"
2. Specifically probe: "Is there an option that involves [asking/applying/joining] rather than [building/preparing/proving]?"
3. Challenge preparation framing: "What would you tell someone else with your current [skills/work/experience]?"

### Domain Manifestations
- **Career:** "I need more projects before applying" → You're already qualified
- **Creative:** "I need to study more craft before submitting" → The work teaches the craft
- **Planning:** "We need more practice before competing" → Competition IS practice

## Discounting Integration Work

### Universal Pattern
Undervaluing work that assembles, curates, or builds upon existing components rather than creating everything from scratch.

### Why This Matters
Senior-level work often IS integration—knowing what to use, how to combine it, and building custom pieces only where needed. Discounting this discounts a real skill.

### How to Recognize It
- "I just used [framework/template/existing thing]"
- "I didn't write every line"
- "Other people's [code/ideas/work] did the heavy lifting"
- "Does it count if I didn't create it from scratch?"

### How to Respond
Reframe: Using existing solutions appropriately IS the skill. The judgment of what to use, how to integrate it, and where to build custom—that's expertise, not a shortcut.

### Domain Manifestations
- **Career:** "I just used community Ansible roles" → You built 17 custom roles where needed
- **Creative:** "I'm using genre conventions" → Skilled use of conventions IS craft
- **Planning:** "I'm just adapting someone else's system" → Adaptation to context is valuable

## Scale Limiting Belief

### Universal Pattern
Dismissing valid experience or work as "not enough" because it didn't happen at some imagined larger scale.

### Why This Matters
Scale is often about systems thinking, not raw numbers. Work done well at smaller scale often demonstrates the same capabilities needed at larger scale.

### How to Recognize It
- "But it wasn't at enterprise scale"
- "Only [small number] people used it"
- "It was just for [limited context]"
- Comparing to imagined "real" versions at larger scale

### How to Respond
1. Challenge the scale assumption: "What specifically would be different at larger scale?"
2. Highlight transferable thinking: "The systems thinking is the same—the numbers are just parameters"
3. Note that many contexts operate at exactly this scale

### Domain Manifestations
- **Career:** "Not enterprise scale" → Zero data loss for 6 years IS operational excellence
- **Creative:** "Small audience" → Depth of impact matters more than breadth
- **Planning:** "Just recreational level" → Principles transfer across levels

## Impostor Trigger Phrases

### Universal Pattern
Certain phrases signal that impostor syndrome is active and Nelson is about to undervalue himself or delay action unnecessarily.

### Why This Matters
These phrases are early warning signs. Catching them allows intervention before they lead to underselling or unnecessary preparation loops.

### Trigger Phrases (Universal)
- "I'm not ready yet"
- "I should [learn/practice/prepare] more first"
- "Maybe I should spend [time period] getting ready"
- "Other people are probably more qualified"
- "Does it count if...?"
- "I just..."

### How to Respond
1. Name the pattern: "That sounds like the impostor pattern"
2. Request evidence review: "Let's look at what you actually have/know/did"
3. Perspective shift: "What would you tell someone else in your position?"
