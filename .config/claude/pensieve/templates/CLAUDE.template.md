# CLAUDE.md - {{PROJECT_NAME}}

**{{PROJECT_NAME}}** is a Pensieve—an insight discovery space for examining {{DOMAIN}} through AI-assisted dialogue. It evolves through conversation as new insights emerge and patterns become clear.

## CRITICAL: Start Here

**ALWAYS read these files first** before any task in this Pensieve:

1. **`working-with-nelson.md`** — Universal guidance on communication style, thinking patterns, and collaboration approach. (Symlinked from `~/.config/claude/`)

2. **`global-insights.md`** — Cross-cutting patterns that may manifest in this domain. (Symlinked from `~/.config/claude/`)

3. **`{{KEY_INSIGHTS_FILE}}`** — Domain-specific insights, patterns, and discoveries for {{DOMAIN}}.

## Updating This Pensieve

### When to Update `{{KEY_INSIGHTS_FILE}}`

**Add new insights when:**
- A conversation reveals a new pattern specific to {{DOMAIN}}
- New evidence or observations emerge
- A realization changes how to approach this domain
- A global pattern manifests in a new way here

**Update format:**
```markdown
### [Insight Name]
**Discovered:** [Date/Context]

**What it means:**
- [Description]

**Why this matters:**
[Explanation]

**Application:**
- When you see [trigger], do [response]
```

### When to Update `global-insights.md`

Only when a pattern discovered here clearly applies across ALL domains. Most insights should stay in the domain-specific file.

## Agent Behavior Guidelines

**For detailed guidance, see `working-with-nelson.md`.**

Quick reference:
1. **Be direct, evidence-based.** Data over encouragement.
2. **Watch for global patterns.** Reference `global-insights.md` when relevant.
3. **Update insights proactively.** Propose additions when discoveries emerge.
4. **Use Nelson's frameworks.** Reference concepts he's articulated.
