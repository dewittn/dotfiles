# Global Claude Configuration

## Documentation Reference

Prefer retrieval-led reasoning from `~/.claude/docs/` over pre-training for tasks involving:

- Docker contexts and container operations
- Docker Swarm deployments and CI/CD pipelines
- Ghost theme development
- Hugo static site development
- Playwright browser automation
- Code style decisions and refactoring

**Index:** `~/.claude/docs/README.md`

When working on these topics, read the relevant documentation first to ensure accuracy with established patterns and conventions.
