# [Feature Name]

**Date**: YYYY-MM-DD
**Context**: What problem is this solving and why now?

## Features

### [Feature Name]
- **What it does**: 2-3 sentences, plain language
- **Why it matters**: What problem it solves or what capability it adds
- **Inputs and outputs**: What goes in, what comes out
- **Constraints**: Architectural decisions, technology choices, patterns to follow
- **Open questions**: Anything unresolved — these are fine to leave open

[Repeat for each feature]

## Implementation Order

1. [Feature] — [rationale, dependency notes]
2. [Feature] — [rationale]

## Next Step

When ready to implement, invoke `/pre-plan` to create the implementation plan. Pre-plan will use this document's constraints and implementation order as its starting point.

## Notes

[Anything that came up in conversation that doesn't fit neatly into a feature
but should be remembered — design philosophy, things explicitly ruled out,
context the implementation planner will need.]
