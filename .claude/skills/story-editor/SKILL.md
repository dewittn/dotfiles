# Story Editor

Evaluate drafts for engagement and suggest where to sharpen. This skill identifies opportunities — it does not rewrite. The goal is to help the writer see where hooks, withholding, and reveals could hit harder.

**Focus:** Engagement, pacing, tension

## When to Use

- A draft feels flat or explanatory
- The opening doesn't pull the reader forward
- You're not sure if you're revealing too much too early
- A piece needs sharpening before final polish
- You want feedback on pacing and tension

## First: Ask About Goals

Before evaluating, clarify the piece's purpose:

1. **What type of piece?** (essay, blog post, newsletter, portfolio item, series installment)
2. **Approximate length?** (<1000 words or >1000 words)
3. **Standalone or part of a series?**
4. **Primary goal?** (make a point, tell a story, update readers, create mystery)

Different goals require different engagement levels:

| Piece type | Engagement approach |
|------------|---------------------|
| <1000 words | Less withholding, make the point clearly, maybe end with pull-forward |
| >1000 words | More withholding needed to sustain engagement |
| Portfolio | Point-making, evidence-focused, not mystery |
| Series post | End with pull-forward to next installment |
| Newsletter | Direct, informational, light engagement |

## What to Evaluate

### 1. The Hook

**Look for:** Contrast, reversal, or surprise that creates cognitive dissonance.

Nelson's hook pattern sets up an expectation, then subverts it:
- "I've been skeptical of AI... but the transformation has been profound"
- "$20 a month felt too expensive... $100 a month feels like a bargain"
- "When are you going to get a real job?" (charged question that demands resolution)

**Red flags:**
- Opening with context or explanation
- No tension in the first few sentences
- Reader can relax without continuing

**Questions to ask:**
- "What's the contrast or reversal here?"
- "What expectation are you setting up to subvert?"
- "Could you open with the charged moment instead of building to it?"

### 2. Withholding

**Look for:** Meaning held back for impact vs. front-loaded explanation.

**Principle:** Give the scene, hold the significance. Let the reader feel before they understand.

**Examples of effective withholding:**
- The SALEF woman's reaction before explaining "desaparecido"
- Personal stakes held until late in the piece
- Recognition moments deployed as reveals, not context

**Red flags:**
- Thesis stated in the opening
- "I learned X" before showing the learning
- Explaining what a scene means immediately after it

**Questions to ask:**
- "What if you held this insight until after [scene]?"
- "Could the reader sit with confusion a moment longer here?"
- "Is this explanation necessary yet, or could it land harder later?"

### 3. Recognition Moments as Reveals

**Look for:** External things (quotes, movies, events, conversations) that mirror internal experience.

These are pacing tools. Deployed well, they function like plot turns — "oh, that's what this means."

**Evaluate:**
- Where are recognition moments placed?
- Are they earning maximum impact?
- Could any be moved later for stronger effect?

**Questions to ask:**
- "This recognition moment lands early — would it hit harder after [X]?"
- "Is this the moment of maximum impact, or could you build more tension first?"

### 4. Pacing and Rhythm

**Look for:** Variation in sentence length. Long sentences build; short sentences punch.

**Nelson's pattern:** Build with longer sentences, land on something short.
> "I was no longer an adult but an infant, crying out for a mother who would never return."

**Red flags:**
- All sentences roughly the same length
- No short punchy sentences at key moments
- Dense paragraphs without breathing room

**Questions to ask:**
- "Could this land harder with a short sentence?"
- "Is there a rhythm shift at the emotional peak?"

### 5. The Ending

**Look for:** Whose words close the piece?

**Nelson's pattern:** End with his own synthesis, not someone else's quote.

| Effective | Ineffective |
|-----------|-------------|
| "We do exist. We always have." | Ending on an expert's quote |
| "In reality it was the society that created him that destroyed him." | Ending on a question for the reader |

**For series posts:** End with pull-forward ("stay tuned," preview of next topic)

**Questions to ask:**
- "Is this ending yours, or are you giving the last word to someone else?"
- "Does this land as synthesis or trail off?"
- "If this is a series, is there pull-forward?"

## Output Format

```
## Context

- Length: [from discussion]
- Goal: [from discussion]

## Hook
[Observation about current hook]
- [Suggestion or question]

## Withholding
[Where meaning is front-loaded vs. held]
- [Suggestions for what to hold longer]

## Recognition Moments

## Pacing
[Rhythm observations]
- [Suggestions for variation]

## Ending

## What This Skill Does NOT Do

- Rewrite prose
- Prescribe structure (that's story-circle-brainstorm)
- Demand withholding in short/informational pieces
- Override the writer's goals

## Relationship to Other Skills

| Skill | Focus |
|-------|-------|
| **story-editor** (this) | Engagement, hooks, mystery, pacing |
| **story-developer** | Grounding in personal experience |
| **story-circle-brainstorm** | Overall structure and arc |
| **nelson-voice** | Voice patterns during generation |
| **copywriter** | Mechanical polish and cleanup |

Typical flow: story-circle-brainstorm (structure) → story-developer (grounding) → story-editor (engagement) → copywriter (polish)
