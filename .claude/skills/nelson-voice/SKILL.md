# Nelson Voice Profile

Write new content in Nelson's voice. This skill is for generating drafts, not cleaning up existing text (use copywriter for that).

## Core Patterns (Always Apply)

### 1. Specificity Over Abstraction

Ground abstract concepts with concrete examples, numbers, names, or references. This includes **dates as narrative anchors**—specific timeframes create movement and sequence in a story.

| Instead of | Write |
|------------|-------|
| "raised a lot of money" | "raised $364,698 from 5,258 backers" |
| "a famous actress's memoir" | "Kate Mulgrew's memoir Born with Teeth" |
| "a memorial wall" | "a 10-foot-high black granite wall, fashioned in the style of the Vietnam Memorial" |
| "I spent months working on it" | "late 2007... March 2008... October 2008" |

### 2. Process Transparency

Show reasoning, not just conclusions. Walk readers through how you arrived at a decision or insight.

**Example:**
> "I purchased the memoir Born with Teeth by Kate Mulgrew to get a better sense of what I would get myself into if I chose the book route... When I finished her book, I remember thinking that there was no way I could replicate that style. Her command of descriptive language was so strong, and I knew that was not my strength as a writer."

The reader sees the input (read the book), the evaluation (couldn't replicate it), and the honest self-assessment (not my strength).

### 3. Personal Entry Points

Stories begin with a moment of arriving, noticing, or discovering—not with "I built X." Ground the reader in *when* you encountered the situation and *what* you observed.

| Instead of | Write |
|------------|-------|
| "I built Inventario for S.B.C. Panamá" | "While visiting in 2007, I noticed that the business was having trouble fulfilling orders..." |
| "I created a Kickstarter campaign" | "When I realized traditional publishing wasn't the right path, I started looking at alternatives..." |

The entry point establishes context before action.

### 4. Motivation Over Ownership

Show *why* you did something, not that you "owned" it. Motivation reveals character; ownership claims signal credentialing.

| Instead of | Write |
|------------|-------|
| "I owned this project from problem discovery to production deployment" | "To help the family business, I leveraged my background in software development..." |
| "I led the initiative to improve the process" | "The team was frustrated with the delays, so I started looking for bottlenecks..." |

### 5. Honest Limitations

Acknowledge constraints, caveats, and uncertainties directly. Not hedging—framing.

| Pattern | Example |
|---------|---------|
| Qualify before claiming | "I've been skeptical of AI for a while now... [then explains utility]" |
| Own limitations | "I knew that was not my strength as a writer" |
| Flag experiments | "This is going to be a bit of an experiment for me" |
| Temper expectations | "Betting that people are going to love your project is not a good strategy" |

### 6. Conversational Asides

Include brief qualifiers that anticipate reader reactions or add nuance.

- "not that I would want to do that anyway"
- "That's not to say those types of books are bad, it's just not what I wanted to do"
- "what the hell I want to say"

These feel natural, not performative. Use sparingly.

### 7. Colons for Explanation

Use colons to introduce explanations, lists, or clarifying statements.

- "LLMs are really good at three things: Association, Analysis, and Summarization."
- "Then it hit me: everything she was describing... were things I had wrestled with my entire life."

### 8. Questions: Rare and Genuine

Only use questions when genuinely wrestling with something or directly engaging the reader.

**Acceptable:**
- "How can I work a normal desk job when there are still families looking for their loved ones?"
- "Does asking yourself this question unlock any doors for you?"

**Avoid:**
- Rhetorical questions used for emphasis
- Questions that are really statements in disguise

### 9. Em Dashes: Rarely If Ever

Nelson's natural writing has almost no em dashes. Use periods, commas, or colons instead.

### 10. Iteration and Continued Observation

Stories rarely follow a clean arc. Show the messy middle: setbacks, failed approaches, things that didn't work the first time. Return to observation when something isn't working.

**Example:**
> "When the contractor quit in March 2008, I took over the development work and rewrote the entire system from scratch. By October 2008, I launched Inventario 2.0. But even the workflow I had developed for my rewrite was too rigid. Workers struggled to locate and restock inventory. So I kept watching."

The process doesn't stop after initial immersion. When something doesn't work, observe again.

## Context Modifiers

### Personal / Narrative Writing

When writing personal essays, reflections, or narrative-driven pieces:

**Sentence rhythm:** Build with longer sentences, land on something short.
> "I was no longer an adult but an infant, crying out for a mother who would never return."

**Recognition moments:** Use external events that mirror internal truths. Show the moment of contact, then let meaning unfold.
> "As I walked through this hollowed ground containing the names of roughly 75,000 people... About halfway down, I found my mother's name, and brushing back tears, I stopped to trace my fingers along the engraving."

**Emotional register:** Understated. "Unmoored" not "devastated." Let weight come from specificity, not adjectives.

**Cultural references:** Use shared references (movies, books, public figures) as bridges to make unfamiliar experiences legible.

### Professional / Informational Writing

When writing portfolio pieces, case studies, or explanatory content:

**Sentence rhythm:** Flatter, more even. Clarity over cadence.

**Evidence focus:** Lead with specific outcomes, numbers, timelines.

**Neutral register:** Measured tone. No enthusiasm injection.

**References:** Use for credibility and context, not emotional bridge.

## Signature Construction (Use Sparingly)

### The Reframe Pivot

> "To most people [surface/dismissive reading], but to those [with real context], [the deeper truth]."

**Examples:**
- "To most people, he was just another menace that was corrupting kids and society. To those who listen to him a lot, he was a great man who was only human."
- "To most people maybe today didn't matter, but to those missing loved ones, to the families of the disappeared, it means everything."

**When to use:** Only for deeply meaningful reframes — defending the misunderstood, revealing hidden significance, pivoting from mainstream dismissal to insider truth. This construction carries weight in Nelson's life and writing. Using it casually dilutes its impact.

**When NOT to use:** Routine explanations, minor clarifications, anything that doesn't involve genuine stakes or a subject that has been misread by the world.

## Anti-Patterns (Avoid)

| Pattern | Why |
|---------|-----|
| Rhetorical questions | Nelson doesn't use them |
| Empty hedging ("perhaps," "maybe" without substance) | He qualifies with honesty, not vagueness |
| Abstract claims without grounding | Always anchor to specifics |
| Injected warmth or enthusiasm | Neutral unless context calls for it |
| Em dashes for emphasis | Use periods or colons |
| Dramatic fragments for effect | Complete sentences preferred |
| Overstated emotion | Understatement is the signature |
| Resume-speak ("owned the project," "led the initiative," "drove results") | Credentialing language; show motivation instead |
| Jargon dressed as insight ("ethnographic immersion," "stakeholder alignment") | Use plain language describing concrete actions |
| Claim inflation ("generated $1.5M" vs "supported $1.5M in revenue") | Be precise about causation; don't overstate contribution |
| Linear success narratives | Real stories have setbacks; include the messy middle |

## When to Ask for More Detail

Nelson's voice requires specific material that can't be invented. If you're missing any of the following, **ask before writing**:

### Entry Point
- When did you first encounter this situation?
- What did you notice that made you act?

### Motivation
- Why did you decide to do this? What was at stake for you personally?

### Timeline and Sequence
- What were the key dates or phases?
- What happened between starting and finishing?

### Setbacks and Iteration
- Did anything fail or not work the first time?
- Did you have to change your approach? Why?

### People and Context
- Who else was involved?
- What were they experiencing?

### Specifics
- What were the actual numbers, names, or details?
- What did people actually say or do?

**Principle:** It's better to ask for the real story than to fill gaps with generic narrative. Nelson's voice depends on material only Nelson can provide.

## Process

1. **Check for missing material** — Do you have entry point, motivation, timeline, setbacks, and specifics? If not, ask.
2. Identify context: personal/narrative or professional/informational
3. Apply core patterns (entry points, motivation, specificity, process transparency, honest framing, iteration, asides, colons, no rhetorical questions, no em dashes)
4. Apply context modifiers (rhythm, register, reference style)
5. Review for anti-patterns
6. Output draft in Nelson's voice
