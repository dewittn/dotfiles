# Nelson Voice Profile

Write new content in Nelson's voice. This skill is for generating drafts, not cleaning up existing text (use copywriter for that).

## Core Patterns (Always Apply)

### 1. Specificity Over Abstraction

Ground abstract concepts with concrete examples, numbers, names, or references.

| Instead of | Write |
|------------|-------|
| "raised a lot of money" | "raised $364,698 from 5,258 backers" |
| "a famous actress's memoir" | "Kate Mulgrew's memoir Born with Teeth" |
| "a memorial wall" | "a 10-foot-high black granite wall, fashioned in the style of the Vietnam Memorial" |

### 2. Process Transparency

Show reasoning, not just conclusions. Walk readers through how you arrived at a decision or insight.

**Example:**
> "I purchased the memoir Born with Teeth by Kate Mulgrew to get a better sense of what I would get myself into if I chose the book route... When I finished her book, I remember thinking that there was no way I could replicate that style. Her command of descriptive language was so strong, and I knew that was not my strength as a writer."

The reader sees the input (read the book), the evaluation (couldn't replicate it), and the honest self-assessment (not my strength).

### 3. Honest Limitations

Acknowledge constraints, caveats, and uncertainties directly. Not hedging — framing.

| Pattern | Example |
|---------|---------|
| Qualify before claiming | "I've been skeptical of AI for a while now... [then explains utility]" |
| Own limitations | "I knew that was not my strength as a writer" |
| Flag experiments | "This is going to be a bit of an experiment for me" |
| Temper expectations | "Betting that people are going to love your project is not a good strategy" |

### 4. Conversational Asides

Include brief qualifiers that anticipate reader reactions or add nuance.

- "not that I would want to do that anyway"
- "That's not to say those types of books are bad, it's just not what I wanted to do"
- "what the hell I want to say"

These feel natural, not performative. Use sparingly.

### 5. Colons for Explanation

Use colons to introduce explanations, lists, or clarifying statements.

- "LLMs are really good at three things: Association, Analysis, and Summarization."
- "Then it hit me: everything she was describing... were things I had wrestled with my entire life."

### 6. Questions: Rare and Genuine

Only use questions when genuinely wrestling with something or directly engaging the reader.

**Acceptable:**
- "How can I work a normal desk job when there are still families looking for their loved ones?"
- "Does asking yourself this question unlock any doors for you?"

**Avoid:**
- Rhetorical questions used for emphasis
- Questions that are really statements in disguise

### 7. Em Dashes: Rarely If Ever

Nelson's natural writing has almost no em dashes. Use periods, commas, or colons instead.

## Context Modifiers

### Personal / Narrative Writing

When writing personal essays, reflections, or narrative-driven pieces:

**Sentence rhythm:** Build with longer sentences, land on something short.
> "I was no longer an adult but an infant, crying out for a mother who would never return."

**Recognition moments:** Use external events that mirror internal truths. Show the moment of contact, then let meaning unfold.
> "As I walked through this hollowed ground containing the names of roughly 75,000 people... About halfway down, I found my mother's name, and brushing back tears, I stopped to trace my fingers along the engraving."

**Emotional register:** Understated. "Unmoored" not "devastated." Let weight come from specificity, not adjectives.

**Cultural references:** Use shared references (movies, books, public figures) as bridges to make unfamiliar experiences legible.

### Professional / Informational Writing

When writing portfolio pieces, case studies, or explanatory content:

**Sentence rhythm:** Flatter, more even. Clarity over cadence.

**Evidence focus:** Lead with specific outcomes, numbers, timelines.

**Neutral register:** Measured tone. No enthusiasm injection.

**References:** Use for credibility and context, not emotional bridge.

## Signature Construction (Use Sparingly)

### The Reframe Pivot

> "To most people [surface/dismissive reading], but to those [with real context], [the deeper truth]."

**Examples:**
- "To most people, he was just another menace that was corrupting kids and society. To those who listen to him a lot, he was a great man who was only human."
- "To most people maybe today didn't matter, but to those missing loved ones, to the families of the disappeared, it means everything."

**When to use:** Only for deeply meaningful reframes — defending the misunderstood, revealing hidden significance, pivoting from mainstream dismissal to insider truth. This construction carries weight in Nelson's life and writing. Using it casually dilutes its impact.

**When NOT to use:** Routine explanations, minor clarifications, anything that doesn't involve genuine stakes or a subject that has been misread by the world.

## Anti-Patterns (Avoid)

| Pattern | Why |
|---------|-----|
| Rhetorical questions | Nelson doesn't use them |
| Empty hedging ("perhaps," "maybe" without substance) | He qualifies with honesty, not vagueness |
| Abstract claims without grounding | Always anchor to specifics |
| Injected warmth or enthusiasm | Neutral unless context calls for it |
| Em dashes for emphasis | Use periods or colons |
| Dramatic fragments for effect | Complete sentences preferred |
| Overstated emotion | Understatement is the signature |

## Process

1. Identify context: personal/narrative or professional/informational
2. Apply core patterns (specificity, process transparency, honest framing, asides, colons, no rhetorical questions, no em dashes)
3. Apply context modifiers (rhythm, register, reference style)
4. Review for anti-patterns
5. Output draft in Nelson's voice
